# Restautant-Project

The provided HTML document outlines a simple yet elegant website for a restaurant named Moonlight Restaurant. This website serves as an online presence for the restaurant, showcasing its ambiance, menu, and contact information. The structure of the document is well-organized, making it easy for users to navigate through different sections such as Home, About, Gallery, Menu, and Contact.

##Key Sections:
Home: Displays a large image that sets the tone for the website. It's a visually appealing introduction to what visitors can expect from the restaurant.

About: Provides detailed information about the restaurant, including its story, cuisine, ambiance, commitment to quality, and sustainability efforts. This section aims to connect with potential customers on a deeper level, sharing the values and philosophy behind the restaurant.

Gallery: Features images of the restaurant's dishes and interior. This visual representation helps to attract customers by showcasing the restaurant's offerings and atmosphere.

Menu: Lists some of the restaurant's appetizers, main courses, and desserts. Each item comes with a brief description, enticing visitors to try them out.

Contact: Offers various ways to get in touch with the restaurant, including phone and email options. Additionally, it provides a contact form for users to send messages directly through the website. This section also includes a simple JavaScript form validation script to ensure that users fill out the form correctly before submission.

##JavaScript Form Validation:
The JavaScript code snippet at the end of the document adds functionality to the contact form. It prevents the default form submission behavior and instead performs client-side validation checks on the input fields (name, email, and message). If any field fails validation, an error message is displayed next to the corresponding input field. If all inputs pass validation, an alert is shown indicating successful message submission, although the actual form submission to an email address (mailto:korerupali24@gmail.com) would not work due to security restrictions in modern browsers.

##Best Practices Followed:

Semantic HTML: The document uses semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, etc., which help improve accessibility and SEO.

Responsive Design: The <meta name="viewport"> tag is included in the <head> section, ensuring the website scales properly on various devices.

External CSS Linking: An external stylesheet (styles.css) is linked for styling, keeping the HTML clean and focused on structure.

Alt Attributes for Images: Alt attributes are provided for images, improving accessibility for visually impaired users.
